            Most colleges have a number of different courses, and each course has multiple subjects. With limited faculties, each faculty teaches more than one subject. Creating a timetable that schedules the faculty at provided time slots, ensuring no overlaps, and making the best use of all faculty subject demands is a complex task.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Automated Schedule Generator utilizes a genetic algorithm for this purpose. It involves a timetable object comprising of classroom objects and the timetable for each classroom, along with a fitness score for the timetable. The fitness score indicates the number of clashes the timetable has with other schedules for different classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Classroom object consists of week objects, which, in turn, contain days. Each day is divided into time slots, and each time slot is assigned to a specific subject, student group, and teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
            The algorithm is designed to be flexible and easily extendable to add or remove various duties. Constraints are checked between two timetable objects, and if a clash is detected, the score is increased accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Automated Schedule Generator is designed to help educational institutions efficiently manage their schedules, ensuring optimal utilization of faculty and resources while minimizing conflicts and clashes.
